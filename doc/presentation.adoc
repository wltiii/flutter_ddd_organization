== Introduction
[quote,Gee Paw Hill (as attributed by Ron Jeffries)]
I’m in the business of changing code

== We Have A Problem

Dissonance between business and engineering:

* Different languages
* Details are lost in translation
* Us versus Them

== Harm Reduction

Commonly accepted approaches are:

* Easily identifiable/relatable artifacts for greater understanding by *all* team members
* Build in a clean, maintainable and extensible fashion achieves:
** Better ability to handle requirement changes
** Speedier corrections to misunderstandings

[.notes]
--
* We all miscommunicate daily, even with people we know very well
** Same language used throughout from business to code
* Business needs change suddenly and often faster than the changes to IT tech - Must be able to handle changes throughout the entire lifespan of an application
--

== Caveats

. The blue and red books are from a largely OO world predating microservices
. At odds with Agile?
. The example application does not implement an Aggregate Root

[.notes]
--
* Domain-Driven Design (the blue book) was published in 2004
* Implementing Domain Drive Design (the red book) was published in 2013
* There was resistance by some in Agile to anything that seemed like BDUP, drawing diagrams, etc.
* Some stated it was only applicable to large projects
* I will talk more about Aggregate Roots later
--

== My Domain Driven Design Background
* I have not used these concepts in a professional project.
* I have read both the blue and red books, in addition to having read others and watching multiple videos.

[.notes]
--
* People state that they really didn't understand DDD until they read the blue book at least three times.
* I don't proclaim to be an expert.
* Structured, OO, Functional and Agile practices have provided feedback loops between code, design and requirements.
* Studying DDD has, like other learnings, improved my understanding across many software development concerns.
--

== A Simple Time Tracking Project
* It allows you to start and stop a timer.
* Displays a list of entries.
* If a timer is running, you are not allowed to start another.
* Conversely, if a timer is not running, you can only start one.

[.notes]
--
* Demonstrate the app
--

== Resocoder's DDD YouTube Video
A good introduction to DDD project structure.

[.notes]
--
* This presentation covers DDD concepts more deeply, I believe, though I watched his video long ago.
* Just learning Flutter when watched so may have missed the forest for the trees
* No two coders will write exactly the same code
* I make use of Type-Driven Design - making invalid state unrepresentable - a different handling of invariants.
--

== Key DDD Concepts Applying To Code
* Naming stemming from the *Ubiquitous Language*
* Invariants managed in domains (DDD says within the *Aggregate Root*)
* High cohesion and minimal coupling via well-defined layers

== Layers
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
...we need to be able to look at the elements of our model and see them as a system. We must not be forced to pick them out of a much larger mix of objects...

== Four Top Level Layers
image::ddd-layers.png[]

[.notes]
--
* Presentation
* Infrastructure
* Application
* Domain (most importantly!)
--

== The Presentation Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Responsible for showing information to the user and interpreting the user's commands.

== !

image::ddd-presentation-layer.png[]

* Depends on the application layer, but not the other way around.
* Should be isolated from the technical details of the implementation, such as data access and external services.

[.notes]
--
* Presentation layer is aka User Interface layer (archaic?)
* Examples are: User Interface and REST APIs
--

== The Infrastructure Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Provides generic technical capabilities that support higher layers: message sending for the application, persistence for the domain...

== !
image::ddd-infrastructure-layer.png[]

* Services calling REST api's or cloud services.
* Services for storing/retrieving data in a database.
* Depends on the *domain layer*.

[.notes]
--
* The repository is obvious from the above definition.
* Firestore provider makes sense. Time entry list provider should be elsewhere perhaps. Feedback welcome!
--

== The Application Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do...The layer is kept thin. *It does not contain business rules or knowledge, but only coordinates tasks*...

== !
image::ddd-application-layer.png[]

* Dispatches requests from the *presentation layer* to the *infrastructure layer* as appropriate.
* Depends on the domain layer.
* Provides abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to maintain loose coupling with the *infrastructure layer*.

[.notes]
--
* These amount to the usecases of the application
* Usecases can be defined in the domain layer as well, if specific to that domain
* Services make up logic used across usecases.
* There are no services in the project.
--

== The Application Repositories Layer

Provides abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to maintaining coupling with the *infrastructure layer*.

image::ddd-application-repository-layer.png[]

[.notes]
--
* I could see having a STORE layer that would be specific to a given repository. That would simplify changing from one storage service to another.
--

== The Application Usecase Layer

Implements the abstractions to maintain loose coupling with the *domain layer*.

image::ddd-application-usecases-layer.png[]


[.notes]
--
* Maintains loose coupling with the *domain layer*.
--

== The Domain Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about the business situation, and business rules... *This layer is the heart of business software.*

== !
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Concentrate all the code related to the domain model in one layer and isolate it from the user interface, application and infrastructure code. *The domain objects, free of the responsibility of displaying themselves, storing themselves, managing application tasks, and so forth, can be focused on expressing the domain model.*

== !
The Domain layer

* Represents the core domain concepts
* Independent of the presentation layer, application and infrastructure layers

[.notes]
--
* Contains all the classes that represent the core domain concepts and entities, such as value objects, entities, and domain services.
* Encapsulates the business rules and logic of the application
* Must be independent of the user interface (presentation layer) and the technical implementation of the application and infrastructure layers.
--


== Domain Models
[quote,Henry Ford]
Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black

image::model_t_production.png[Ford Model T Production Line, 400, 250]

Represent real world object that are related to the problem/domain space.

[.notes]
--
* Models are templates that are potential entities
* Two models having the same value for all attributes are equal
--


== Domain Entities

image::1925-ford-model-t-with-license.jpg[Licensed Ford Model T, 400, 250]

An entity represents a single instance of a model distinguished by an identifier.

[.notes]
--
* Note the license plate as an identifier
--

== !
image::model_t_production.png[Ford Model T Production Line, 400, 250]

*For all intents and purposes*, one Model T is no different from any other except for the serial number.

[.notes]
--
* I wrap models with entities giving it an ID. The entity provides little else of value except convenience methods.
* Doing this makes some other functions cleaner. For example, *Add* functions do not need an entity, thus no need for a nullable ID.
--

== Value Objects

_Value objects_ represent a value in the domain, without having a distinct identity.

image::ddd-domain-layer-usecase-value-objects.png[]

[.notes]
--
* Models and Value Objects differ in that models are templates for entities, whereas Value Objects are not.
* Value objects can be comprised of other value objects, models or entities.
* They are used as attributes of entities, models and other value objects.
* For example, value object _StartTime_ is an attribute of both TimeEntryModel and TimeEntryRange value object
--

== Domain services
_Domain services_ implement *business* logic that is not specific to a particular entity in the domain.

An example could be summing the hours over a given time period.

[.notes]
--
* I had no need at present in this project.
* I prefer a more OO approach, keeping functions and data together, but sometimes that is pretty ugly and this separation is better.
--

== What Is An Aggregate Root?
* A gateway to a cluster of related objects, known as an aggregate.
* A single unit of change and consistency in the domain model.
* Ensures that changes made to the objects within the aggregate are valid according to the business rules.
* Typically exists in the Domain top-level folder, as it is a core domain concept.

[.notes]
--
* The only object within the aggregate that can be directly accessed.
* The enforcer of the invariants of the aggregate.
* For example: folder time_entries is a cluster of related objects. That folder could be hidden with only a publicly exposed TimeEntriesAggregate class.
--

== Example Aggregate Roots
* E-commerce
** Aggregate: Order
** Related object: line items, shipping addresses, payment details...
* Banking application
** Aggregate: Account
** Related objects: transactions, balances, and account holders...

== !
* Blogging application
** Aggregate: Post
** Related objects: comments, categories, tags, and authors...
* Hotel reservation application
** Aggregate: Reservation
** Related objects: room details, guest info, payment details, booking history...

[.notes]
--
* TimeTracker does not have a canonical Aggregate.
* Implications:
*   Individual objects prevent invalid instantiation
*   Persistence is handled from the Application layer - some confusion in
*   resources
*   Dart does not have a Protected visibility exposing what aggregates are
*   meant to hide. Could be mitigated through the use of libraries.
* In TimeTracker the aggregate would likely be TimeEntry.
* Tempted to name it TimeEntryAggregate
--

== Conclusions
* Should improve communication with end users, analysts, architects, etc.
* Great separation of concerns, improved cohesion and coupling
* Developing from an actual DDD analysis and design might have lead to better alignment
* I needed to revisit layer definitions frequently.
* There seemed to be a lot of conflicting information on the web

[.notes]
--
* Better understanding of DDD would likely improve results
* I would like to discuss with people that are more expert
* The app will likely be further expanded
