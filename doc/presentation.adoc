== Introduction
[quote,Gee Paw Hill (as attributed by Ron Jeffries)]
I’m in the business of changing code

== We Have A Problem

Dissonance between business and engineering:

* Different languages
* Details are lost in translation
* Us versus Them

== Harm Reduction

Commonly accepted approaches are:

* Easily identifiable/relatable artifacts achieves greater understanding by *all* team members
* Built in a clean, maintainable and extensible fashion achieves:
** Better ability to handle requirement changes
** Speedier corrections to misunderstandings

[.notes]
--
* We all miscommunicate daily, even with people we know very well
** Same language used throughout from business to code
* Business needs change suddenly and often faster than the changes to IT tech - Must be able to handle changes throughout the entire lifespan of an application
--

== My Domain Driven Design Background
* I have not used these concepts in a professional project .
* I have read both the blue and red books, in addition to having read others and watching multiple videos.

[.notes]
--
* people state that they really didn't understand DDD until they read the blue book at least three times.
* I don't proclaim to be an expert.
* Structured, OO, Functional and Agile practices have provided feedback loops - better code and better understanding
--

== A Simple Time Tracking Project
* It allows you to start and stop a timer.
* Displays a list of entries.
* If a timer is running, you are not allowed to start another.
* Conversely, if a timer is not running, you can only start one.

[.notes]
--
* Demonstrate the app
--

== Resocoder's DDD YouTube Video
A good introduction to DDD project structure.

[.notes]
--
* This presentation covers DDD concepts more deeply, I believe, though I watched his video long ago.
* Just learning Flutter when watched so may have missed the forest for the trees
* No two coders will write exactly the same code
* I make use of Type-Driven Design - making invalid state unrepresentable - a different handling of invariants.
--

== Key DDD Concepts Applying To Code
* Naming stemming from the *Ubiquitous Language*
* Invariants managed in domains (DDD says *Aggregate Root*)
* High cohesion and minimal coupling via well-defined layers

== Layers
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
...we need to be able to look at the elements of our model and see them as a system. We must not be forced to pick them out of a much larger mix of objects...

== Four Layers

[.notes]
--
* Presentation (known as User Interface in blue book)
--

== The Presentation Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Responsible for showing information to the user and interpreting the user's commands.

== !

image::ddd-presentation-layer.png[]

* Depends on the application layer, but not the other way around.
* Should be isolated from the technical details of the implementation, such as data access and external services.

[.notes]
--
* Presentation layer is aka User Interface layer (archaic?)
* Examples are: User Interface and REST APIs
--

== The Infrastructure Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Provides generic technical capabilities that support higher layers: message sending for the application, persistence for the domain...

image::ddd-infrastructure-layer.png[]

== !
Infrastructure layer examples:

* Services calling REST api's or cloud services.
* Services for storing/retrieving data in a database.
* Depends on the *domain layer*.

[.notes]
--
* How does it depend on the domain layer???
--

== The Application Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do...The layer is kept thin. It does not contain business rules or knowledge, but only coordinates tasks...

image::ddd-application-layer.png[]

== !
* Dispatches requests from the presentation layer to the *infrastructure layer* as appropriate.
* Depends on the domain layer.
* Provides abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to maintain loose coupling with the *infrastructure layer*.

[.notes]
--
* These amount to usecases
--

== The Application Repositories Layer
image::ddd-application-repository-layer.png[]

== !
* Provides abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to maintain loose coupling with the *infrastructure layer*.

[.notes]
--
*
--

== The Application Usecase Layer

image::ddd-application-usecases-layer.png[]

== !
* Implements abstractions to maintain loose coupling with the *domain layer*.

== The Domain Layer
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Responsible for representing concepts or the business, information about the business situation, and business rules... *This layer is the heart of business software.*

== !
[quote,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design]
Concentrate all the code related to the domain model in one layer and isolate it from the user interface, application and infrastructure code. *The domain objects, free of the responsibility of displaying themselves, storing themselves, managing application tasks, and so forth, can be focused on expressing the domain model.*

== !
The Domain layer

* Must be independent of the user interface (presentation layer) and the technical implementation of the application and infrastructure layers.
* Encapsulates the business rules and logic of the application
* Contains all the classes that represent the core domain concepts and entities, such as value objects, entities, and domain services.

[.notes]
--
* Deeper explanation???

== Domain Models

image::model_t_production.png[Ford Model T Production Line, 400, 250]

A model typically represents a real world object that is related to the problem or domain space.

== Domain Entities

image::model_t_production.png[Ford Model T Production Line, 400, 250]

An entity represents a single instance of a model identified with an _id_. Two entities can have all the exact same attributes, distinguishable only by their id.

== !
image::model_t_production.png[Ford Model T Production Line, 400, 250]

For #all# intents and purposes, one Model T is no different from any other except for the serial number.

== Value Objects

_Value objects_ represent a value in the domain, without having a distinct identity.

* They can be comprised of other value objects.
* They can be comprised of entities.
* They are used as attributes of entities.

For example, _PersonName_ would be a value object and would be an attribute of Person entity.

[.notes]
--
* Show value objects
--

== Domain services
_Domain services_ implement *business* logic that is not specific to a particular entity in the domain.

An example could be summing the hours over a given time period.

== Caveats

. The blue and red books are from a largely OO world (and not microservices!)
. The example application does not implement an Aggregate Root

== !
[.notes]
--
* Domain-Driven Design (the blue book) was published in 2004
* Implementing Domain Drive Design (the red book) was published in 2013
--


== What Is An Aggregate Root?
. Acts as a gateway to a cluster of related objects, known as an aggregate.
. An *aggregate root* typically exists in the Domain top-level folder, as it is a core domain concept.
. It represents a single unit of change and consistency in the domain model.
. It also acts as a boundary for the consistency of the aggregate, ensuring that any changes made to the objects within the aggregate are valid according to the business rules.
. The only object within the aggregate that can be directly accessed.
. The enforcer of the invariants of the aggregate.

== Example Aggregate Roots
* E-commerce
** Aggregate: Order
** Related object: line items, shipping addresses, payment details...
* Banking application
** Aggregate: Account
** Related objects: transactions, balances, and account holders...
* Blogging application
** Aggregate: Post
** Related objects: comments, categories, tags, and authors...
* Hotel reservation application
** Aggregate: Reservation
** Related objects: room details, guest info, payment details, booking history...

[.notes]
--
* TimeTracker does not have a canonical Aggregate.
* Implications:
*   Individual objects prevent invalid instantiation
*   Persistence is handled from the Application layer - some confusion in
*   resources
*   Dart does not have a Protected visibility exposing what aggregates are
*   meant to hide. Could be mitigated through the use of libraries.
* In TimeTracker the aggregate would likely be TimeEntry.
* Tempted to name it TimeEntryAggregate
--

== Conclusions
* Should improve communication with end users, analysts, architects, etc.
* Great separation of concerns, improved cohesion and coupling
* Developing from an actual DDD analysis and design might have lead to better alignment
* Revisited layer definitions frequently
* There seemed to be a lot of conflicting information on the web

[.notes]
--
* Better understanding of DDD would likely improve results
* I would like to discuss with people that are more expert
* The app will likely be further expanded
